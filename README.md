# CancerPredictionModel
A model to predict cancer from wide data sample using supervised machine learning algorithms.

"mutations.csv"  includes 271 samples of cancer and non-cancer patients with a combination of 7500 gene mutations. 
This model "CancerPredictionModel" learns from this data to predict patients who have cancer from their gene makeup.
Supervised Machine Learning algorithms:
- Decision trees
- Greedy algorithm
- Random Forest
